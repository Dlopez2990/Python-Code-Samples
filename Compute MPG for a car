- Write a program that will compute MPG for a car. Prompt the user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons used. Print a nice message with the answer.
# This program computes MPG (Miles Per Gallon) for a car.
# Function to compute MPG
def compute_mpg():
    miles_driven = float(input("Enter the number of miles driven: "))
    gallons_used = float(input("Enter the number of gallons used: "))
    mpg = miles_driven / gallons_used
    print(f"The MPG for the car is: {mpg:.2f}")
    print(f"Your a great driver by the way!")
# Test the program
compute_mpg()
