# Python-Code-Samples
These are my Python programs from the Module 3: Lab Activity 
recall what we learned in Module 1 about commenting and documentation?
Comments are non-executable lines of text in code that provide explanations or notes about the functionality of the code. 
Comments are useful for other developers (myself included) who later read the code and understand its purpose and logic.
Making clear comments make your code easier to read and understand, and improve maintainability.
Documentation ensures a thorough comprehension of the software's structure and behavior, promotes developer cooperation, and allows for efficient software development and project management.
Write comments that explain the purpose of functions not just what the code does, but why.Â
