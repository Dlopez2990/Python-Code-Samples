- Write a program that will compute the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter
the radius and print a nice message back to the user with the answer.
# This program computes the area of a circle.
import math
def compute_circle_area():
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    area = math.pi * radius**2
    print(f"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f} square units")
    print (f"Also did you do something with your hair it looks nice")
# Test the program
compute_circle_area()
